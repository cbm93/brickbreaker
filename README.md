This project was created with Java.

# How does it work?

This game involves the user to use a paddle and ball in order to destory 21 bricks, once all the breaks are gone the user is given a score and the option to restart the game. If the ball misses the paddle the user automatically loses the game.

# Comments

The aim of this project was to take my Java skills to the next level. It was a very fun game to make and has inspired me to create more like it.
