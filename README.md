# Introduction

Too familaire myself with Java again I have made this game as a project for myself that I can add too and make better. 
I plan on upgrading the GUI of the game while also adding arcade music which I will also create myself.

# Running the game
You can clone this repo and add it as an existing project in any Java IDE.
